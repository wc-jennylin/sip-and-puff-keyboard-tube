# sip-and-puff-keyboard-tube
I designed this Sip-And-Puff "Keyboard" tube especially for people who do not have arms, hands, or fingers to type conveniently. Users are able to type by only sipping(inhaling) and puffing(exhaling) through the colorful tube. Users can scan through the alphabets, numbers and symbols by sipping the tube, then puff shortly to select that input. Space could be added by puffing for about a second. There is no deletion function as a metaphor to prompt the users to think about what they want to convey, be cautious with the word choice, also live in the moment and not dwell in the past.
